## File Types

### Packet Tracer Files
- **.pkt** - Standard Packet Tracer network topology files
- **.pka** - Packet Tracer Activity files with embedded instructions

### Configuration Files
- **R#.txt** - Router configuration files (e.g., R1.txt, R2.txt)
- **S#.txt** - Switch configuration files (e.g., S1.txt, S2.txt)
- **PC.txt** - PC/endpoint configuration
- **All.txt** - Combined configuration for all devices
- **Code.txt** - Command reference and scripts

## Prerequisites
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Version 7.0 or higher)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Familiarity with Cisco IOS commands

## How to Use

1. **Open Packet Tracer Files**: Double-click any .pkt or .pka file to open in Cisco Packet Tracer
2. **Review Configuration Files**: Open corresponding .txt files to view device configurations
3. **Apply Configurations**: Copy commands from .txt files and paste into device CLI in Packet Tracer
4. **Test Connectivity**: Use ping, traceroute, and other commands to verify network functionality
5. **Save Progress**: Regularly save your work in Packet Tracer

## Learning Objectives

Throughout these labsheets, you will learn:
- Basic router and switch configuration
